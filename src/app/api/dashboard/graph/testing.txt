steps in my head
1. group by date
2. sum 3 fields, totalRevenue, paidRevenue, pendingRevenue
3. put then into json

SELECT 
CAST("createdAt" as DATE) as date,
SUM(CASE WHEN "status"='PAID' THEN ROUND("total",2) ELSE 0 END) AS "paidRevenue",
SUM(CASE WHEN "status"='PENDING' THEN ROUND("total",
2) ELSE 0 END) AS "pendingRevenue",
SUM(ROUND("total",2)) AS "revenue"
FROM "Invoice"
GROUP BY CAST("createdAt" AS DATE);



SELECT 
  CAST("createdAt" AS DATE) AS "date", "currency"
  json_build_object(
    'totalRevenue', SUM(ROUND("total", 2)),
    'paidRevenue', SUM(CASE WHEN "status" = 'PAID' THEN ROUND("total", 2) ELSE 0 END),
    'pendingRevenue', SUM(CASE WHEN "status" = 'PENDING' THEN ROUND("total", 2) ELSE 0 END)
  ) AS "graphData"
FROM "Invoice"
GROUP BY CAST("createdAt" AS DATE)
ORDER BY CAST("createdAt" AS DATE) ASC;



SELECT CAST("createdAt" as DATE) as "date", 
        json_agg(
        json_build_object (

2),
            'status',

        ))
        AS "invoices"
        FROM "Invoice"
        GROUP BY CAST("createdAt" AS DATE)
